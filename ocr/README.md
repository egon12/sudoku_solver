# OCR

This is attempt to create Model using Neural Network with Tensorflow

First you need to prepare the image first.
you can run 

```
python3 box.py
```

To split the image.

The class and value is already in folder class

I delete to save the space

## TODO

For now there are duplicate between ipynb and learn.py
We need to make it one, and maybe we can move this into colab google.com
So we can use cloud computing to do the learning
